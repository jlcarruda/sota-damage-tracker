# Damage Tracker for SOTA

Mod to track damage per second from party and individual character.
The difference between this mod and the other damage trackers is that the mod is running Lua code inside the game, so no need of other programs running other than the game.

## Instalation

The SotA has a folder inside the `AppData` folder of the player computer. This code (folder and .lua file in root) will be inside the following folder:

`C:/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/Portalarium/Shroud of the Avatar/Lua`
